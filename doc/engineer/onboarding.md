### Email lists you care about and want to be on
Hopefully when you were hired this was set up for you.

gardens-eng@acquia.com  
engineering@acquia.com  
everybody@acquia.com  

### Jabber
All the [group chats at acquia](https://i.acquia.com/wiki/jabber-group-chats)  
You care about
- gardens-eng
- everybody
- engineering

### Calendars
We live and die by our calendars.  If you want to know what is happening in the general engineering
organization you will want to subscribe to acquia's engineering calendar.  Also of interest might be:
- ops (to know who is the the ops hotseat)
- release (so you know when stuff might be shipped)
- Mark Winberry (So you know when you can goof off)

You will notice on the gardens calendar that there are some events that get marked off
- gardening day (Typically one during the sprint and 1 between sprints) Contribute to your favorite open source or pet project that
  moves the engineering team (or the open source tools we use) forward
- Sprint End/Demo (Since every sprint should have some code that can be released, we should demo it and brag how great we are.
  We do not have Scrum meetings on demo day)
- pencils down (Ideally in an agile environment, we could finish coding the day before demo day, release it and demo our live code.
  In practice, gardens is a tough enough problem with many features that really needs a bit of baking time.) At pencils down we should have
  coded and working features and successfully be able to build a release candidate.
