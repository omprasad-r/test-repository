Terms you may hear the gardens team utter
=========================================

**Warnerboarding**: A long and somewhat painful series of sizing meetings were large and intractable epics are broken down
into larger and even more intractable stories.  It is not *warnerboarding* unless you have gone through the same idea of
implemtation and potential tasks more than once and discarded them.

**Wakaflocka**: synonmyn for WTF in gardens. Uttered during an "interesting" launch of a WMG site. While this is the 
name of the artist, the timing of the utterance fit perfectly with a WTF moment.

**Gluncertainty**: A state of mind experienced when investigating filesystem strangeness that could apparently only be caused by a gluster client that has failed though it continues to simulate filesystem correctness as best it can.

**Glonfusion**: Occurs after gluncertainty has been investigated and the cause determined to be a gluster client that desperately needs to be restarted.  When the client fails often the file metadata is corrupted.

**What's the TTL**: Some of our customers are very heavily cached via a CDN.  If you get something on the internet, 
it is going to be there for a while.  This is usually uttered after having pushed a theme change or javascript change
that will take a while (the TTL) to clean out.

**CTFC**: Adopted from the support organization, this is a panacea parallel to the IT motto "turn it off an back on again" - **Clear the [frequently?] cache**.  Often if you don't know what else to do to fix a problem, clearing the cache might well do it.  Or not, but, at least you know you tried something.
