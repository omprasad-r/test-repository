This button sprite has all of the graphics for the display of themebuilder buttons in various states.

The idea is that you would have 2 spans jammed together, the left span
would include the left part of the button and be the width of some
left padding (to provide space for the rounded edge) and the width of
the text contained in the button.  The right span would consist of
enough padding to show the right round, with no left padding.

State  	       	       Y-offset
---------------------------------
normal			-2px
hover			-31px
pressed			-60px
primary-normal		-89px (primary normal is a blue button)
primary-hover		-118px
primary-pressed		-147px
disabled		-176px

For the right endcap, the Y offset is the same as above, and the
X-offset is -291px.

This should be used throughout the themebuilder for all buttons, but
is currently only used in the advanced tab.
